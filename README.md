# My Simple Python Text Editor Project

the editor can open and save python files
the editor can also run a python code by simply calling the os.system function to simulate a 'py file.py' cmd
and pipes its output to a 'result.txt', and then call a function that read the 'result.txt' file and writes the
text on the output window
